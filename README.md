###📝 Introduction
Employee performance is crucial for business success. In this project, I analyze various factors such as training hours, salary, work experience, and overtime to understand their impact on performance.

##📌 Objective:

Identify key factors influencing employee performance.
Provide actionable insights for HR teams.
Use data storytelling to make findings clear.
#📂 Dataset
#📌 Dataset Used: IBM HR Analytics Employee Performance Dataset

#Dataset Features:
Employee Demographics: Age, Gender, Job Role
Job-Related Factors: Salary, Overtime, Years at Company
Performance Metrics: Performance Rating, Training Hours
###🛠 Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python 🐍
###Libraries:
pandas – Data Cleaning & Analysis
numpy – Numerical Computations
seaborn – Data Visualization
matplotlib – Graphical Representation
📊 Project Workflow
###1️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned missing values
Handled categorical data
Normalized numerical features
###2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized performance trends using Seaborn
Identified correlations between training, salary, and performance
###3️⃣ Feature Analysis & Insights:

Explored the impact of overtime and salary on performance
Analyzed training hours and job roles
###📈 Key Insights & Visualizations
📌 1. Higher Training Hours Lead to Better Performance

📌 2. Overtime Negatively Affects Performance

📌 3. Promotions & Performance are Strongly Linked

➡ Insight: Employees with frequent promotions show higher performance ratings.
Employee turnover is a major challenge for companies, leading to higher costs and loss of talent. After analyzing IBM’s HR data, we identified the key factors affecting employee attrition:

### Low salary drives employees to seek better opportunities. Long commuting distance leads to stress and dissatisfaction. Excessive overtime causes burnout and work fatigue. Lack of career growth and promotions pushes employees to leave. Poor work-life balance increases the likelihood of resignation. New employees tend to leave more due to adjustment issues. High-performing employees often receive better job offers from competitors.

### Solutions to Reduce Attrition Increase salaries for low-paid employees. Offer flexible work arrangements for employees with long commutes. Limit excessive overtime to improve work-life balance. Enhance training and promotion opportunities to retain talent

🎯 Conclusion
Employees who receive more training perform better.
Overtime negatively impacts performance due to burnout.
Companies should focus on training programs & work-life balance.
